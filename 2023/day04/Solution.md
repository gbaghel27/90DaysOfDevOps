Q. Explain in your own words and examples, what is Shell Scripting for DevOps.

Sol. Shell Scripting is a scriting language in which we can run multiple commands in one time. Using shell script we can optimize the our time and efficiency to perform tasks.

Q. What is `#!/bin/bash?` can we write `#!/bin/sh` as well?

Sol. 
#!/bin/bash explicitly specifies Bash as the interpreter, ensuring that the script's behavior is consistent across systems that have Bash installed. This is useful when you rely on Bash-specific features or syntax.

#!/bin/sh relies on the system's default Bourne-compatible shell, which may vary. If you want your script to be as portable as possible and don't rely on Bash-specific features, you can use #!/bin/sh. 

you can use either #!/bin/bash or #!/bin/sh at the beginning of your script, depending on your specific requirements. If your script depends on Bash features, it's better to specify #!/bin/bash to ensure consistent behavior. If you want maximum portability and don't rely on Bash-specific features, you can use #!/bin/sh.
